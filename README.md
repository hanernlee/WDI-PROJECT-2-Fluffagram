## Challenges

The main challenge for me was to figure out what sort of application I wanted to built in 5 days. I found myself tossing up between ideas and coming back to them only to be back at square one. Learning to stick to one idea and being committed to it was definitely important.

One of the technical challenges I faced in building this application was in trying to understand how file upload works in the backend and getting the uploaded images stored on a hosting server.

The other challenges included:
- Assigning a delete button(with popup modals) to each image on the same page
- Validating email or username that was already taken
