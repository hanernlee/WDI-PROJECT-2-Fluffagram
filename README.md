## Challenges

The main challenge for me was to figure out what sort of application I wanted to built in 5 days using CRUD operations. I found myself tossing up between ideas and coming back to them only to be back at square one. However, I finally settled on a photo sharing application as I wanted to explore the mechanism behind successful platforms like Instagram and Facebook.

On a more technical note, the first challenge was to try to understand how file upload works in the backend and to get the uploaded images stored on a hosting server. The other technical challenge was to figure out how to assign a delete button(with modals) to each image on the same page
